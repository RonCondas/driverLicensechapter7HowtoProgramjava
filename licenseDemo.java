 In this exercise, I wrote a class named DriverExam that holds the correct answers to the exam in an array field. The class should also have an array field that holds the studentâ€™s answers. The class should have the following methods:

passed. Returns true if the student passed the exam, or false if the student failed

totalCorrect. Returns the total number of correctly answered questions

totalIncorrect. Returns the total number of incorrectly answered questions

questionsMissed. An int array containing the question numbers of the questions that the student missed */
